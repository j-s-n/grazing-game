# grazing-game
The Grazing Game, a model of a community sharing a resource that deteriorates if over-used.

In the grazing game, a graph is described wherein the nodes are resource generators("glens"). Agents called "sheep", in aggregates called "flocks", wander across the graph consuming these resources.
